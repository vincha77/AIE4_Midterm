These rights aim to protect you from abusive data practices and ensure that your privacy is respected in an increasingly automated society."
What rights do I have to ensure safe and effective systems?,"You have the right to be protected from unsafe or ineffective systems. Automated systems should be developed with input from diverse communities and experts to identify risks and impacts. They must undergo pre-deployment testing, risk identification, and ongoing monitoring to ensure they are safe and effective. You also have the right to not have a system deployed or to have it removed if it poses a risk to your safety or the safety of your community. Automated systems should be designed to proactively protect you from unintended harms."
What rights do I have to ensure that I am given adequate explanation and notice re the use of AI systems?,"You have the right to be informed when an automated system is being used and to understand how and why it contributes to outcomes that impact you. Designers, developers, and deployers of these systems are required to provide accessible documentation that includes:

1. Clear descriptions of the overall system functioning and the role of automation.
2. Notice that such systems are in use.
3. Information about the individual or organization responsible for the system.
4. Explanations of outcomes that are clear, timely, and accessible.

Additionally, you should be notified of significant changes in use cases or key functionalities. You have the right to know how and why an outcome affecting you was determined by the automated system, including when it is not the sole input determining the outcome. The explanations provided should be technically valid, meaningful, and useful to you and others who need to understand the system."

How can organizations put data privacy into practice?,"Organizations can put data privacy into practice by proactively identifying potential harms and managing them to avoid, mitigate, and respond appropriately to identified risks. This includes determining not to process data when privacy risks outweigh the benefits and implementing measures to mitigate acceptable risks. 

Additionally, organizations should follow privacy-preserving security best practices, such as using privacy-enhancing technologies and fine-grained permissions and access control mechanisms to ensure that data and metadata do not leak beyond the specific consented use case. 

Consent should be meaningful and understandable, with requests presented in plain language, allowing users to have agency over their data collection. Enhanced protections should be in place for sensitive domains, ensuring that data is only used for necessary functions and that users are protected by ethical reviews and prohibitions on misuse. 

Finally, organizations should avoid design choices that obscure user choice or impose privacy-invasive defaults, ensuring that users are free from unchecked surveillance."
How can organizations put into practice protection against algorithmic discrimination,"Organizations can put into practice protection against algorithmic discrimination by implementing several key strategies:

1. **Regular Assessment**: Organizations should regularly assess their automated systems to determine if they have led to algorithmic discrimination. This includes monitoring the system's outcomes and identifying any patterns of unusual results.

2. **Diverse Testing Approaches**: The assessment can be conducted using various methods, such as testing with a sample of users or conducting qualitative user experience research, especially when demographic information of impacted individuals is available.

3. **Increased Monitoring for High-Risk Systems**: Systems that are deemed riskier or have a higher impact should be monitored and assessed more frequently to ensure they adhere to equity standards.

4. **Disparity Mitigation**: If the assessments reveal disparities, organizations should take steps to mitigate these issues. This may involve adjusting the system or reverting to earlier procedures that better meet equity standards.

5. **Proxy Features Management**: Organizations should ensure that any proxy features used in their systems are not given undue weight and should monitor these closely to prevent algorithmic discrimination.

By following these practices, organizations can work towards minimizing the risk of algorithmic discrimination in their automated systems."
