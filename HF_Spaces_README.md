Code features:
1.  Text splitter - RecursiveTextSplitter from Langchain

4.  Chat model is OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini.
5.  There are two variants of the app that can be deployed:
    a.  An early prototype built using OpenAI Embeddings text-embedding-3-small
    b.  A more advanced prototype using finetuned version of `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m`
        the finetuned version is available at `vincha77/finetuned_arctic`
