It is cost-effective, relatively easy to tune if needed, is well-suited for answering queries that are SIMPLE and those that require MULTI-CONTEXT.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Semantic chunking has great appeal as it groups content that is contiguous and semantically similar in a single chunk.  To that end, the chunk sizes may be rather uneven.  Advantage: It avoids artificially splitting content that may be very similar into multiple chunks which would make the retriever work harder during the retrieval process and/or perhaps miss relevant context.  The downside is that it is not as cost-effective as it requires the use of an LLM during the chunking process.  It is likely to perform well for MULTI-CONTEXT and potentially queries that require REASONING."

This includes conducting bias testing as part of product quality assessments, developing standards and guidance for automated systems, and ensuring oversight of human-based systems to mitigate potential biases. Additionally, addressing challenges related to datasets, testing and evaluation, and human factors is crucial in managing AI bias.\n"

For example, if a health insurance company receives data to facilitate payment, that data should only be utilized for that specific purpose. Additionally, organizations should implement measures to mitigate, transfer, or avoid risks that exceed their risk tolerances, which can help in managing data privacy effectively. Regular information sharing, maintaining change management records, and keeping version history and metadata can also support organizations in responding to and managing data privacy incidents.\n",

They are medium-sized vectors (dimension of 1536) and have decent context length (8191), so they can be used to encode fairly long chunks of text well.\n",

Generation-based measures such as faithfulness (measuring factual accuracy of generated answer) and answer relevancy (relevance of answer to question) also suffer with poor retrieval performance.  Notice the poor performace of the snowflake-arctic-embed-m model’s generation measures and how the retrieval measures are also pretty low.\n",

It is possible that semantic chunks, at least some of them, are long.  The recursive text splitter may be better suited to smaller context length embedding models as one can control the size of the chunks relatively easily.\n",

Occasionally, the chatbot may respond with \"I don't know\".  If it does that, try a more specific variation of your question.  Our chatbot is only designed to answer questions about AI’s risks, framework for measuring and managing its risks and mitigating/reducing the likelihood of adverse societal outcomes from poor management of AI tools and models.  To that end, we’d like the stakeholders that we recruit to help us on this double mission: educate themselves on the risks and educate themselves on how we as a company can adopt ideas from AI into our own business units.

        "In this application, I used an in-memory instance of the vector database to store content from the two PDFs provided for this assignment.  If we need to add more documents with the exact same pipeline, we will literally need to re-instantiate the entire pipeline by rebuilding the vector database: (a) because the vector DB is in memory and (b) there is a single monolithic block of code that does everything from the creation of the vector indexing as well as the RAG querying.  Clearly this is not a scalable way of doing things.\n",

        "How we can augment this approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "a.\t*Implement persistent on-disk vector databases.*   All major vector database providers offer this capability.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "c.\t*Improve the architecture of the retrieval process itself.*  For example, if there are new versions of previously released documents, then we may need our vector DB to maintain, for audit and other reasons, the older versions of these documents.  In that case, we can put the metadata to work – e.g., identify documents by their release date, or date-added to our vector DB.  Additionally, use metadata in the retrieval process e.g., we select out more recent versions of documents to search for and phase out older documents from the search and retrieval process.\n"
